#### About the app
This was done in respect to task 3 given to us. it a country app that show all countries and their details

#### About the codebase
The project was built with flutter. Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase. First described in 2015, Flutter was released in May 2017.

During development, Flutter apps run in a VM that offers stateful hot reload of changes without needing a full recompile. For release, Flutter apps are compiled directly to machine code, whether Intel x64 or ARM instructions, or to JavaScript if targeting the web.

#### External Libraries
Below are the external libraries used
- [Google font](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts)
- [Url launcher](https://pub.dev/packages/url_launcher)

- [DIO](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) 


[Google font](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts) is an official google plugin containing all google's font families. I decided to use it so as to make my pubspec.yaml file neater and fewer lines of code. 

[Url launcher](https://pub.dev/packages/url_launcher) is a flutter plugin for lauching url. It was used to launch my external url (e.g. twitter, linkedIn and resume download link).

[Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) is a wrapper around InheritedWidget to make them easier to use and more reusable. It was used because it's my favorite of all state management tool.

[Fancy Shimmer Image](https://pub.dev/packages/fancy_shimmer_image), package created for the purpose of uploading images from the internet, giving the possibility of showing a beautiful Shimmer animation while the images are not loading.
It was used to give off shimmer while image loads up to enhance/increase user experience.

[DIO](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) A powerful Http client for Dart, which supports Interceptors, Global configuration, FormData, Request Cancellation, File downloading, Timeout etc.
